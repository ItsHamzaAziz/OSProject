# Operating Systems Project

## Overview
This is my Operating Systems Semester Project.
<br>In this we were required to implement a scheduling algorithm in a real world scenario.

## Scheduling Algorithm
The scheduling Algorithm used here is FCFS (First Come First Serve).

## Scenario
We selected the scenario of a superstore checkout simulation.

## Working of Code
Starting from obtaining number of customers in queue for checkout, this program takes one by one input of items they have.
<br>Then the code calculates burst time, completion time, turnaround time and waiting time for each customer which is in the end displayed.
